# Piirit

*A native SailfishOS client for [Delta Chat](https://delta.chat).*

## What this is

Delta Chat is a chatmail messenger with end-to-end encryption, no phone
number and no central operator.

The thesis is narrow: **do not build a messenger, build a SailfishOS UI on
top of one.** Protocol, cryptography and storage are the upstream core's.
Piirit contributes the presentation layer, the platform integration and
the packaging, and aspires to ships to Jolla's Harbour app store.

## What this isn't

- **Reimplementing any protocol logic** — no IMAP/SMTP/MIME, no Autocrypt,
  no encryption. If protocol code is being written, the core dependency is
  being misused. This is the most important boundary in the project.
- **Hand-written C FFI bindings.** The CFFI exists; JSON-RPC is the
  sanctioned, lower-maintenance path.
- **A push-notification service.** No Delta Chat push infrastructure is
  available to third-party clients.
- **Plain-email chats.**
- **Multi-protocol bridging**, a **desktop or web build**, and **running a
  chatmail server**. Single-purpose client only.
- **Old Sailfish releases.** One modern baseline, expanded only for future
  Jolla products. [Buy a Jolla Phone 2026](https://commerce.jolla.com/) and
  support European-made alternatives. 👊🇪🇺🔥
- **Shipping via OpenRepos/Chum.** Harbour or nothing: a platform that is
  competitive for regular, non-technical people is one that needs no
  developer mode, no SSH to fix small things, and no community repos.
  That means [dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food),
  and telling Jolla what the platform is still missing.

## Architecture

```
QML / Silica UI
        |  models / signals
Rust shim (qmetaobject-rs): JSON-RPC client, event loop -> Qt queued
signals, QAbstractListModel adapters for chats/messages/accounts
        |  JSON-RPC over stdio
deltachat-rpc-server (bundled binary, subprocess) = the entire core
```

## Platform baseline

- Toolchain floor **Rust 1.75.0, Qt 5.6.3** — what Sailfish ships.
- Built against the **5.2** SDK, the Jolla Phone's baseline. Anything older
  is out of scope: a binary from a newer SDK can call symbols an older
  phone lacks, and that is accepted rather than worked around. Harbour
  requires it too -- it rejects a binary that does not link
  `__libc_start_main@GLIBC_2.34`, which only a 5.x glibc provides.
- `aarch64` and `armv7hl` for devices; `i486`/`x86_64` for the emulator.
- Account storage is the core's own, pinned inside the sailjail grant at
  `$XDG_DATA_HOME/piirit/piirit/accounts` (`PIIRIT_ACCOUNTS_DIR`
  overrides).

## What is missing

In order of what matters:

1. **Harbour-readiness.** Every rule a source tree can answer is now a
   mandatory CI gate (`ci/harbour-check.sh`, `HARBOUR.md`), and the real
   validator runs against each built RPM. One blocker remains, and it is not
   fixable here: the bundled `deltachat-rpc-server` is a second ELF
   executable, which Harbour permits nowhere.
2. **Message polish**: avatars on bubbles, and a way to react with an
   emoji the quick row does not offer.
3. **The rest of the webxdc API.** Apps are sent, shown and run
   (`webxdc.rs`, `WebxdcPage.qml`), and status updates go both ways. What
   is not offered is the newer calls -- `importFiles`, realtime channels.
   Nor is an app's `source_code_url` shown anywhere.
